# MLOps Final Project

## Project Statement

Between 20-50 million people are injured each year in traffic accidents and over 1 million die. These are now the global killers over individules ages 5-29. We have technology, Advanced Driving-Assistance Systems that are intended to aid drivers and improve safety. ADAS are an essential component of autonomous vehicles, and to that end, traffic sign recognition is a pertinent problem. Such systems can allow the vehicle to detect and recognize traffic signs in every direction, especially when drivers may not. The faster the rdetection and classification, especially compared to human reaction time, the greater the possible safety advantage granted to the driver.

To this end, sophisticated traffic sign classification systems are a necessary component of any ADAS system. This project will implement a toy example using a Convolutional Neural Network via Keras with the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). Although this is not ideal for a production vehicle, such applications could be useful for model testing by data scientists, or for monitoring production models as well as possible redundancy.

Chosen because I am interested and it is relatively small, should be easier to download/unpack etc.
